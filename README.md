# Dowling's Bar & Grill

Welcome to Dowling's Bar & Grill, a combination of an American sports bar and an Irish pub. The objective of this website is to provide potential customers with a website to view our menu, read about our restuarant, book a table and get updates on upcoming events happening in the bar. The goal of the website for an admin is to be able to manage, confirm and cancel bookings from a central hub by logging in securely with an email and password. An admin will also have the ability to add, edit and delete menu items from the website, making sure the website is always kept up to date for their customers.

To achieve the goals of this project I have used full stack software development tools including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django and Python.
